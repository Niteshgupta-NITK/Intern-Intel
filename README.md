# Intern Intel

A website that assists research enthusiasts in finding their ideal internship. Students can use this website to search through college websites for internship positions rather than having to go through the tedious process of checking up the profiles of each professor in the college. Furthermore, users can add professors or colleges to which they would like to intern, and they will be notified through email anytime a position becomes available.

## Features
